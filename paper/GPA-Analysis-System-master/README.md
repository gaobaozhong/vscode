# GPA-Analysis-System
GPA Analysis System is a prediction model type of Machine Learning System. The main idea behind the project is to analyze the CGPA obtained by the students and make the predictions on GPA based on the different factors which have direct or indirect effect on GPA obtained. The main purpose of this system is to analyze the studentsâ€™ academic performance based on these factors.

The extracted dataset was first used to summarize the data using visualization techniques. The data was plotted to understand each attributes and the relationship between the attributes. Then some models of the data were created and their accuracy on unseen data were estimated. Then the loaded dataset was splitted into two, 80% of them were used to train the models and 20% were held back as validation dataset. Cross Validation technique was used to test the accuracy of the models we created. Then analyzing the different algorithms, best model was identified. And finally the predictions on GPA was made based on the best model we selected before.

The dataset used in the project was prepared by the current Computer Engineering 3rd year students of Kathmandu University. It was collected by using a google form with various questions and sharing it to various classes.  

Most of the coding work is done by ownself with the help of official documentation of python, sci-kit learn, pandas and the algorithms used.
