#background and significance

1. background:
    * virtualizaiton, intelligence and digiization
    * invariance, robustness and sparsity
    * combination of 3d visual experience and information processing
2. significance
    * human body information anlysis: 2d-2.5d-3d-combination of 2d and 3d
    * feature description adn modeling : feature learning -feature fusion-feature assocaition
    * personalized ontrolled serice: stan-alone serviec-netowrk interconneciton-interratctive experience-intelligent perception

# the content of reaerch

# sparse regularized hasing for multi-modal laerning

* motivationU& contributiong :
1. Exsting metods nly focus on the cross-modal connection;discuss the combiatnato focross-modal conneciton and various within-modality regularizaitnterms:
* bi-linear form - cross-modal conneciton 
* fromulatin:  
    * fromaulatonfor two modality
* optimization：
* experimental setting & results:
* contriutiosn:


# SVD-based deep network compression for asr

* motivation: the rlarge size fo nn parametres bring shigh computation and memory cost. 
* framework 
* proposed method 
    * firstly,wek learn the importance of each layer by analyzing he property of its singular values . And we apply singel value decompositon on the weight matries
* experiments & results
