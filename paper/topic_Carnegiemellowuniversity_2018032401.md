# Public Event Reconstruciton

* Can we provide interactive toosl to help 'reconstruct' what happedn at a puhblic event
* Mroe and more video s are recorded and streamed /uploaded by everyon
    * Nee to find ones that are relevat
        * Reorded at hte right time
        * Reorded at the riaght place
    * Synchronization over time
    * Geo-localization
    * Tracking of frouops/individula
    * Forensic-styule reconstruction

# Conllenges

* Variable quality,'unplanned' video and images

# Synchronization

* Synchronizeing event videos in tie in an qunsupervidsed fashien
* minimizing human effortes for event reconstructgion
* spatial -temporal alignment and retrievel

# Example

* Alignment and retrivel for important/intersting events 
    * several camera viewsws

# Plipleline Overview

* Video Segmentation
* Audio Feature Exatraction
* Audio Finger Printing
* piar -wise mathicng
* pari-selection

# Alignment Arppraoch

* Content-based automatic audio alignment
    * match video pairs baased on broadcast, sirens,exs
