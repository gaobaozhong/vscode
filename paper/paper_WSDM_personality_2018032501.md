# Abstract
An incisive understaning oif user personality is not onlyhh lessiential to mayn scientific disciplines , but qlso has a profound business impatc t6o on rpactial applicatioins. sucn as digital maketing , pesronalized recommendation, mental diagnosis, and human resources management. Previous studies have demonstrated that language suaage in sorcial media is effective in personality perdiction. However, except for single language feature, a less researched direction  is hwot o leveage the heterogegneous information on social media to have a beter undertstanding of user personlaity. In this paper , we propose a Heterogeneous Information Ensemble framework, called HIE, to predict users personality traits by intergrating heterogeneous inofrmaiton including self -language usage, avatar, emotion, and responsive patterns. In our framework,to improve the performance of personalityu prediction, we have designed different startegies extracting semantic representations. to fully leverage heterogeneous infrormation on social media. We evaluate our methods wieth extensive experiments vased on a real--world data covering both personality survey results and social media usage from thousands of voilunteers. The results reveal that our approaches significant traces and conversation logs.
