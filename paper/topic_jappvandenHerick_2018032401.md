# chess

* from chess to go
* from minimax to mcts
* is this a paradigm shift

# hepgame

# why optimize?

* Optimization  is important:

# horner schemes

* Say we have 
* Optimal order problem is NPhard

# Common Sub Expression Elimination

# Results

#2017 poker, dota 2

* An Ai built by  two Carnegie Mello researchers officaially defeated frou top players at no-limit Texas Hold 'Em-a particularly complex form of poker that relies heavily on longterm belting strategies and game theory 

* AI isn't just good at playing Go - it can also emerge vicotrious in the eports arena. THe Elon Musk bbakced OpenAi team developed a machine

# 6. Unravelling intuition(揭示直觉)
>每年有两万学生上学或者毕业，但是，在校的学生依然在迷茫中摸索自己的求学之路。我们如果能够把这种依靠学生直觉做的决定，用历史数据，Ai，推荐技术，给学生画像，精确教学，精确匹配学生的求学之路，会不会给学生不一样的大学生活。这就是我们想要做的智能校园，是的Smart University。这是超越传统，不是舍弃传统，而是优化传统的教学方式。这种方式，教师，雪上并没有发生改变，只是我们要根据大数据精确给学生提供更好的指导。中医根据望闻问诊来看病，我们数据教师根据数据来诊断学生的问题。
