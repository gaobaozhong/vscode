d:/Users/gao/Documents/Code/tex/test_2018040301.tex:2: Argument of \title has a
n extra }
I've run across a `}' that doesn't seem to match anything.
For example, `\def\a#1{...}' and `\a}' would produce
this error. If you simply proceed now, the `\par' that
I've just inserted will cause me to report a runaway
argument that might be the root of the problem. But if
your `}' was spurious, just type `2' and it will go away.

Runaway argument?
d:/Users/gao/Documents/Code/tex/test_2018040301.tex:2: Paragraph ended before \
title was complete
I suspect you've forgotten a `}', causing me to apply this
control sequence to too much text. How can we recover?
My plan is to forget the whole thing and hope for the best.
